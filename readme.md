Project Title: Online Library 

Project Description: This is the first project of the advanced part of the Odin Project Javascript Course. It's the first project where I was required to use Object and Object Constructors to make it work. 

Problem I solved during this project: I actually had an eureka moment when I figured out how to change the value of a name/value pair by either checking or unchecking the box in the popup form. Which makes me very happy because I'm seeing progress as I move along.
